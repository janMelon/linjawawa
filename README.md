## Using the Font
### Typing Basic Words
When you type a toki pona word, it will be automatically converted to its sitelen pona glyph. E.g. if you type the word "pilin", then it will be converted to sitelen pona glyph for "pilin" which looks like a heart (â™¡). Currently, all *pu* words and *ku suli* words are available in this font.

One-letter toki pona words, like "a", "e", and "o" will only be converted into their sitelen pona glyphs if you add a space after it or if you type the same letter twice. Otherwise, it will only show as a latin character. E.g. typing "e" will result in the latin character (e), but typing "e " or "ee" will give you its sitelen pona glyph which looks like a sideway double chevron (>>).

### Name Cartouche
Names in toki pona are written by putting glyphs inside a cartouche. The first sound of each glyph spells out how the name is pronounced. To start a cartouche, type a left square bracket (&#91;). Then, type an underscore (&lowbar;) to make the upper and lowet lines of cartouche. Now you can type any sitelen pona glyph and it will automatically be put inside the cartouche. To close the cartouche, type a right square bracket. E.g. "jan Melon" can be written as "jan [&lowbar;ma&lowbar;esun&lowbar;lukin&lowbar;open&lowbar;nena]".
